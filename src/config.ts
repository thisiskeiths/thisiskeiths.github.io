  aboutMe:
    "Exhibition and Experience Producer with a foundation in design and hands-on production, dedicated to turning artistic vision into tangible reality. I guide multifaceted projects from museums and brand activations to public art and immersive installations through their entire lifecycle. At the core of my work is translating conversations across disciplines, connecting artists, curators, brands, and fabricators to align vision with feasibility. The result is projects where creativity is grounded in reality: buildable, on-schedule, budget-conscious, and visitor-centred.",
